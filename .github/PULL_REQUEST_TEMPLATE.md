## TDD Checklist (required)

- [ ] I added one or more failing tests that demonstrate the desired behavior before implementing production code.
- [ ] I confirmed the new test(s) fail locally before writing production code.
- [ ] I implemented the minimal production code to make the tests pass.
- [ ] I ran the full test suite locally and all tests pass.
- [ ] The failing-test commit is included in this branch history (the failing test must be present in the PR history before or alongside production code).

If the TDD checklist is not applicable for this PR (e.g., documentation-only or chore), explain why in the description.
