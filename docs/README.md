## Writing Documentation Using AI

There are four examples of how to influence and use AI to write documentation in this repository:

- [Custom agents](../.github/agents/README.md) — Specialized AI behaviors for tasks like development, testing, and code review. As of October 2025, GitHub renamed "Chat Modes" to "Agents".
- [Custom chat modes](../.github/chatmodes/README.md) *(deprecated)* — Preset conversational configurations that shape Copilot's behavior and tone during interactive sessions and document generation.
- [Instructions](../.github/instructions/docs.instructions.md) — Repository-specific rules and constraints (coding standards, workflow, style) that the AI must follow when producing content.
- [Prompts](../.github/prompts/write-docs.prompt.md) — Reusable prompt templates for generating consistent artifacts (e.g., ADRs, docs, PRDs). See also [write-adr.prompt.md](../.github/prompts/write-adr.prompt.md) and [write-prd.prompt.md](../.github/prompts/write-prd.prompt.md).
